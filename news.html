        <h3>History of Popular Music</h3>

            The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early
19th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of sheet music" The availability
of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music
pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur music-
makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. In addition to the influence of sheet
music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century
of public popular music performances in pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular theatres
and concert rooms. The early popular music performers worked handin-hand with the sheet
music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to
attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singerjenny Lind, who toured the US in the
mid19th century. During the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music by
participating in amateur choirs orjoining brass bands.

      <h3>In Every Work of Genius We Recognize Our Own
Rejected Thoughts</h3>
        <p class="dates">
          by brody vercher on december 12, 2014

        <p>
        I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not
conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may.
The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your
own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,that is
genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due
time becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the
Lastjudgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to
Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what
men, but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which
flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre ofthe firmament of bards and sages.
Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we
recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.
Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our
spontaneous impression with good- humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of
voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely
what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own
opinion from another.
